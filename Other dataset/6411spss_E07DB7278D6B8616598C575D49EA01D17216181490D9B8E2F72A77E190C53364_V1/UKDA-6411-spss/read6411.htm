<h3 style="font: normal normal bold small verdana;color:#191970;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:10">DATA CURATION PROCEDURES</h3>
<p>
Data acquired for the UK Data Service collection undergo rigorous and comprehensive curation prior to publishing and release.  This ensures that data, documentation and metadata are processed and published to the highest standard possible, both for ease of use in secondary analysis and for archival preservation.
</p>
The curation procedures carried out depend on the individual nature of each dataset and document, but as a general guide the following tasks are always undertaken:
<ul>
<li>Disclosure review - if data confidentiality issues are identified, they are resolved in consultation with the data depositor;</li>
<li>Data are checked for consistency and accuracy â€“ for example undocumented/out-of-range codes; </li>
<li>Variable and value label metadata are checked and enhancements undertaken as necessary;</li>
<li>Multiple data and documentation formats may be generated for dissemination and preservation;</li>
<li>A catalogue metadata record is generated and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is assigned to the study where appropriate.</li>
<li>Where the data are made available for online analysis, in addition to the checks above, question text may be added alongside variables and other enhancements made.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font: normal normal bold small verdana;color:#191970;margin-top:10;margin-bottom:10">NEW EDITION INFORMATION</h3> 
For the ninth edition (October 2022), a new data file mcs4_family_interview has been added due to the family level data being split out from the parent-level data to make future merging with MCS8 onwards easier. Two data files (mcs4_parent_interview and mcs4_parent_cm_interview) have been updated to include variables that were missed from the previous edition (income and employment module) due to a technical error. There have also been edits to some variable labels that had been found to be incorrect. In addition, the number of cases in the mcs4_hhgrid data file have changed due to updates. Users are advised to check the Longitudinal Family File held under SN 8172 for the sample size.
